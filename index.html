        I'm a graduate of UW-Oshkosh with a Bachelor of Science and, because I
        couldn't decide what I loved more, double majored in Computer Science and Mathematics.
        I enjoy sharing my passions and tutored for both majors throughout my schooling.
        Contact me if you are looking for an astute, deep-learning, dedicated problem-solver.

    <h2>aTAM Simulator</h2>
    <p>
        This is a 3D simulator that is programmed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; built on top of the WebGL API.
        This means that is should be able to run on any modern browser and computer with sufficient graphical processing power.
    </p>
    <p>
        The abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM) is a model used by researchers and mathematicians in the field of self-assembly.
        The model takes a tile set as input and then constructs an assembly tile by tile.
        Beautiful and intricate constructions can be rendered from simple tile sets.
    </p>

        Visualizing constructions can be extremely tedious on a chalkboard and research papers are seldom accompanied by more
        than a few still images to explain how their constructions work.
        Being able to hyperlink directly to a simulator and input tile set would make for a strong academic tool.
        A demo is preloaded into the simulation, so even if you don't have your own tile set to input, you can still see how it works.

    <p>
        <img src='images/AppleHunt.png' width='480' hspace='20' style='float:left;'>
        This was the final project for my computer Graphics Course. The goal of the project was to demonstrate techniques in lighting, 
        texture mapping, and model manipulation. More specifically, it uses the Lambertian and Gouraud shading models with small additions
        for distance lighting. Along with standard rectangular 2D texture mapping, the game also uses cylindrical and spherical mapping for certain models.
    </p>
    <p>
        The objective of this pacman-esque game is to collect as many apples as possible without getting caught. Although not told to the player,
        you can change the second screen's camera angle to get a better look at some of the models or to increase the challenge. These angles
        are selected with keys 1 through 6.

    <p>
        <img src='RCube1.png' width='200' hspace='20' style='float:right;'>
        The purpose of this Computer Graphics project was to demonstrate basic model transformation techniques.
        The cube can be scrambled and is fully solvable, though the current control and camera scheme makes that a difficult task.
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src='RCube2.png' width='200' hspace='20' style='float:left;'>
        The application also features a unique display mode that is better suited for a 2D screen.

    <p>
        <img src='fractal1.png' width='200' hspace='20' style='float:right;'>
        While there exists some disagreement among mathematicians,
        fractals are what I would call an infinite repetition of patterns.
        Computer scientists actively perform research with fractals due to their
        applications in graphics rendering and file compression.
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src='fractal2.png' width='200' hspace='20' style='float:left;'>
        This program allows you to click-in basic geometric shapes and then render an
        infinitely repeating pattern with two different drawing styles. One style
        being the by-level fractalization and the other being spray-paint
        fractalization. An IFS code is also output. The IFS code is useful
        for recreating specific fractals and demonstrates just how little information
        is needed to represent such complex structures.

        This is a simple game of Connect Four that you play against an Artificial Intelligence.
        The AI opponent uses alpha-beta pruning in its search algorithm and is
        extremely difficult to beat.

    <h2 style='clear:both;'>Sujiru Solver</h2>
    <p>
        <img src='sujiru.png' width='200' hspace='20' style='float:right;'>
        Sujiru is a made up game. In a fashion similar to Sudoku, a square grid is
        initialized with 0's and 1's scattered throughout its cells; all other cells
        are blank (represented by a '-' symbol).  The goal is to fill in all remaining cells
        with 0's or 1's such that there are never three 0's or three 1's in sequence (vertically or horizontally)
        and such that each row and column has an equal number of 0's and 1's.
    </p>
    <p>
        This small project demonstrates several programming techniques
        related to Artificial Intelligence. More Specifically, it models the game of Sujiru as a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_satisfaction_problem">
        Constraint Satisfaction Problem</a> and then solves it with backtracking.
        My written code is contained in "sujiru.py", while the rest comes from an AI library.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can create or modify an existing Sujiru board by editing the text in
        the files "p1.txt", "p2.txt", or "p3.txt". Run the program by executing "sujiru.py".
