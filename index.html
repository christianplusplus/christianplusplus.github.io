    <h4>Welcome to my portfolio!</h4>
    <p>
        My name is Christian Wendlandt.
        I'm a graduate of UW-Oshkosh with a bachelor's in Computer Science and Mathematics.
        I like to play video games in my free time, so (naturally) many of my projects are game related.
        Taking a concept, figuring out the math to represent it, and then making it interactive is always an enjoyable experience.
        I also like teaching others; so being able to do so visually, and then seeing an idea 'click' for them is very satisfying.
    </p>

        Below this is a collection of projects that I've completed or am still working on.
        JavaScript projects are hosted right on gitHub, so they should run on modern browsers by just following the links.
        Other projects will have varying levels of set up, which is discussed in their README's.
