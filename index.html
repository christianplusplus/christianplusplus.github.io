    <h1 style='text-align:center;clear:both'>About Me</h1>
 
    <p>
        My name is Christian Wendlandt. I enjoy automating my life and winning games with math.
        I graduated at UW-Oshkosh with a Bachelor of Science.
        I started out as a math major and later shifted my focus to computer science; eventually I double majored.
        I enjoy sharing my passions and have tutored in both areas at the request of faculty.
        I've spent the last few years in Warehouse Management Systems as a web/app/internal tools developer.
        My favorite projects usually include graphics, computer architecture, assembly language, and game theory.
        Contact me if you're looking for an astute, deep-learning, and dedicated problem-solver.

    <h2>gideonstruedamage.com</h2>
    <p>
        <img src='images/gideonstruedamage.png' width='480' hspace='20' style='float:right;'>
        This is a website that I own and developed which solves an optimization problem in the popular game "Elden Ring".
        With Vue.js and web workers, it provides a responsive, reactive, single-page, and serverless user interface.
        The site also shows important game data, which is otherwise difficult to deduce for the player.
    </p>
    <p>
        The game utilizes RPG character progression and other systems which require player choice and resource allocation.
        This calculator produces optimal character builds based on restrictions provided by the user.
        This is achieved by culling "hilly" argument combinations, using a steepest ascent algorithm to find maximum value, then appling brute force to the culled "hilly" regions.

    <h2>aTAM Simulator</h2>
    <p>
        <img src='images/aTAM.png' width='480' hspace='20' style='float:left;'>
        This is a 3D simulator that is programmed in JavaScript with the WebGL API.
        It should be able to run on any modern browser and computer with sufficient graphical processing power.
    </p>
    <p>
        The abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM) is a model used by researchers and mathematicians in the field of self-assembly.
        The model takes a tile set as input and then constructs an assembly tile by tile.
        Beautiful and intricate structures can be rendered from simple tile sets.
    </p>
    <p>
        Visualizing constructions can be extremely tedious on a chalkboard and research papers are seldom accompanied by more
        than a few still images to explain how their constructions work.
        Being able to hyperlink directly to a simulator and input tile set would make for a strong academic tool.
        Demos are preloaded into the simulation, so even if you don't have your own tile set to input, you can still see how it works.

    <h2 style='clear:both;'>Apple Hunt</h2>
    <p>
        <img src='images/AppleHunt.png' width='480' hspace='20' style='float:right;'>
        This was the final project for my computer Graphics Course. It does not utilize any pre-built graphics engine. The goal of the project was to demonstrate techniques in shading, 
        texture mapping, and model manipulation. More specifically, it uses the Lambertian and Gouraud shading models with small additions
        for distance lighting. Along with standard rectangular 2D texture mapping, the game also uses cylindrical and spherical mapping for certain models.
    </p>
    <p>
        The objective of this pacman-esque game is to collect as many apples as possible without getting caught.
        You can change the second screen's camera angle to get a better look at some of the models.
        These angles are selected with keys 1 through 6.

    <h2>Connect Four Bot</h2>
    <p>
        <div id='console'></div>Written in Python, Connect Four Bot is an AI opponent capable of playing Connect Four.
        It utilizes Alpha-Beta pruning with a custom state analysis algorithm to determine optimal lines of play.
    </p>
    <p>
        This Python window is implemented with Skulpt, a Python-to-JavaScript compiler. Click the button to start the game.
        There is some delay caused by this translation, so I've included a link to the original python script which can be run natively.
        Options like player order and search depth can also be modified in the original program.

    <h1 style='text-align:center;clear:both'>My Research</h1>
    
    <p>
        Leading up to my final year at UWO, I was offered an assistant researcher role
        by the Department Chair of the CS department. This was a summertime
        position which fulfilled the internship requirements of my CS degree.
        Two of the department's professors are dedicated to the field of self-assembly,
        which is a mathematics-heavy subfield of computer science. I was considered
        a good fit for the position because of my math major and mastery
        of recent high-level coursework.
    </p>
    <p>
        The goal of the research practicum was to prove or disprove the existence
        of a smaller upper bound on the complexity of a certain self-assembly construction.
        There were several phases to the research practicum:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Learning the subject matter.</li>
        <li>Submitting a research proposal.</li>
        <li>Establishing a thesis.</li>
        <li>Writing an algorithm that proved the thesis.</li>
        <li>Integrating my findings with my professors' research paper.</li>
        <li>Reflective writing assignment and presentation.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        The project was fully completed on time and the findings published in Summer of 2019.
